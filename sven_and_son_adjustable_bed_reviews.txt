#### Product Description:

I purchased the wall-hugging Twin XL premium bed frame and the 14” thick mattress. This bed frame came in a large, narrow, well-packaged box. The box is heavy but reflects how this bed frame was made. It's solid and well-made. This would be best handled with two people with a little muscle. I, however, tackled this alone and was able to assemble and place the frame in its final location.

After installing the legs, ensure that pressure on the legs is minimal when tipping it right-side up. I used blocks of 4x4s to take most of the weight of the frame to relieve the side pressure on the legs when tipping it over.

The mattress came in a cylindrical heavy-duty bag about 4 ft x 1.5 ft in size. After removing the outer bag, the mattress is tightly packed in an airtight plastic wrap/bag. You must take care when cutting this wrap/bag off to avoid cutting into the mattress. While cutting the wrap/bag's last part, the mattress springs out. Ensure you have adequate room to let the mattress expand. I let my mattress expand for 24 hours before using it.

The mattress I got wasn't too firm or too soft. It is just right… very comfortable. All bed functions worked great with the provided remote, but the phone app had some issues connecting to the bed. It worked (connected) one day, then not the next. I hope they'll be able to fix it in upcoming updates. However, this review is about the bed and not the app. I'll rate the app on the Play Store.

I truly love this bed, and here are some reasons why:
- I'm 250 lbs, and this bed can accommodate every position with ease. It's very quiet too.
- I FINALLY slept through the night. No more sleeping aids.
- My arthritic hip and chronic back pain (L5-S1) feel MUCH better after a night's sleep on this bed. I almost cried from happiness when I woke up without the horrible pains.
- Love the wall-hugging feature - no more dropped pillows behind the bed.

I thank Sven & Son and SleepGeekz for this fine product. They can have everything I own, except for this bed. They'll have to pry it from my dead cold fingers to take it from me. Not kidding. This bed is worth every penny!

#### Product Description:

We bought the 14" Split King, Luxury Cool Gel Memory Foam Mattress set with head tilt. Love it! It fits nicely in our old frame. The fold in the mattress when elevated is no big deal, unnoticeable. No more snoring. The vibration is like being rocked to sleep, and the sound is soothing like a white noise machine. The 14" mattress is not as soft as our old bed, but we do sleep much better.

No more hip, shoulder, or back pains in the morning. I thought we would use the head tilt more when watching TV but we don't. It's not necessary when I have a pillow behind my head. I no longer use 5 pillows. I only need one. The light under the bed is nice, not too bright. If I had to change anything, it would be to purchase the unit that moves back towards the headboard when the mattress is elevated.

We can't reach our nightstands as easily, and it's an inconvenience worth mentioning. Also, a recommendation for the designer is to make the foot vibration more powerful. Note, no need to toss out old bedding. We bought twin XL fitted sheets only and still use our Cal King top sheets, blankets, and comforters. I highly recommend this set. I will not go back to a traditional bed.

#### Product Description:

We looked at many adjustable beds before deciding on this one, but I'm so glad we chose this. It is a wonderful bed! The adjustable base is great for my severe, chronic back pain (that zero-G setting feels like heaven on my bad days), and it helps my husband with his hiatal hernia and acid reflux (we're a mess LOL), not to mention snoring! Plus, it's great to be able to sit up to read in bed.

We went with the 14" hybrid mattress, which is great. It has the softness and cushion of foam mattresses, but the underlying support of innerspring. Neither of us has any complaints.

#### Product Description:

We have been sleeping on this for about 7 weeks now. We have enjoyed this bed. We have had some adjustments to the split King setup, and I am not sold on the crease in the center. That is not a problem with the manufacturing or the bed itself but with the style in general.

The remotes come already paired with their side of the bed, and there is a sync button line with the power cable if needed. The three different vibration levels are sufficient for just a light amount up to a good rumble.
